## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dataRetrieval)
```

```{r}
gages <- read_csv("App_Gages.csv")

'%!in%' <- function(x,y)!('%in%'(x,y))
gages <- gages %>% filter(SECTION %!in% c("SEABOARD LOWLAND", "NEW ENGLAND UPLAND",  "ST LAWRENCE VALLEY"))

gages <- gages %>% filter(ACTIVE09 == "yes")

gages <- gages %>% filter(FLYRS1990 >= 20)
```

```{r}
sitenos <- gages$STAID

readNWISdv(sitenos[1:10], "00060", "1991-01-01","2021-01-01")
```
